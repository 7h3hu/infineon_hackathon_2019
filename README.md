A project created at the Infineon hackathon 2019.

## Usecase

The Infineon hardware wallet smart card is used to store identity tokens using zero knowledge proofs in order to perform age verification without revealing any personal data.

## Implementation

### Hardware Wallet Smart Card with NFC Interface

The `Blockchain Security 2Go Starter Kit` was provided by Infineon (https://www.infineon.com/blockchain) including libraries to access the wallet functionality (https://github.com/Infineon/blockchain).

The smart cards are used to store `Identity Tokens` on the Ethereum blockchain which essentially contain a reference to the (zero knowledge) proof stored on the IPFS network.

### Ethereum Smart Contract

An Ethereum smart contract, written in Solidity using the Truffle framework, is used to issue so-called non-fungible `Identity Tokens` (ERC-721). Those tokens are not transferable and each wallet can only contain one of them (as it represents an identity).

### Zero Knowledge Proof

A simple algorithmic circuit is used to create zero knowledge proofs using `snarkjs` (https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs). The resulting `proof.json` is uploaded to IPFS and a reference to it is stored on the Ethereum blockchain using an `Identity Tokens`.

### Frontend Application

We created a Python frontend application using Flask. The script polls the NFC reader to detect new card wallets. As soon as a wallet is detected, we read the wallet address and check the Ethereum blockchain for an identitiy issued to this wallet. If an `Identity Token` is found, the zero knowledge proof is read from IPFS and verified. Upon success/failure the frontend shows a corresponding result.
